              Compensation for Latency in XR Offloaded Tasks Using Pose
              Prediction
            </h2>
            <p className="textOfProject">
              This project was the Masterâ€™s thesis for my degree in Virtual and
              Augmented Reality. The aim was to minimize perceived latency in
              AR/MR applications by using head movement tracking and pose
              prediction algorithms to synchronize content with user movements,
              ensuring a seamless and immersive experience. <br /> <br /> As AR
              and MR glasses advance, offloading computational tasks to edge
              networks or the cloud enhances their capabilities but introduces
              latency issues. Latency, caused by data transmission delays, can
              negatively impact user experience, for example, causing VR
              sickness. By addressing this challenge, our research contributes
              to the development of more practical and user-friendly AR/MR
              devices.

              An immersive VR project developed in collaboration with Ukrainian
              students at Zhytomyr Polytechnic State University. It showcases
              the traditional Ukrainian midsummer celebration, Ivana Kupala.
              This project aims to bring cultural heritage to life by allowing
              users to experience the vibrant festivities, folklore, and rituals
              associated with this ancient holiday. <br /> <br /> Through
              detailed virtual environments and interactive elements, users can
              explore various aspects of the celebration, including bonfires and
              floral wreath-making. This project highlights the potential of
              virtual reality in promoting cultural traditions.

              Real Time Visualization of 5G Signal Waves in AR and VR
              Environment
            </h2>
            <p className="textOfProject">
              This project involved collaborating with Ericsson to develop a
              system for visualizing real-time 5G directional beams. This
              project aimed to enhance the understanding of 5G technology by
              creating a visual representation of 5G signals within augmented
              and virtual reality environments. <br /> <br /> The visualization
              was deployed in the Ericsson lobby, providing an interactive and
              educational tool to demonstrate the capabilities and behavior of
              5G signal waves. Two versions of the application were developed:
              an AR version for use within the actual Ericsson lobby, and a VR
              version for remote use, allowing users to experience the 5G
              visualizations in a virtual recreation of the lobby.

              Treasure-Hunt Fighter is an engaging and challenging game where
              players maneuver a spaceship in space to hunt for treasure balls.
              The game emphasizes strategic navigation and quick reflexes to
              avoid asteroids that are randomly placed and respawn with
              different positions, adding an element of unpredictability.
              <br />
              <br />
              Players must constantly adapt their strategies to successfully
              navigate through the changing obstacles, making each playthrough a
              unique experience. The thrill of collecting treasure balls while
