              Compensation for Latency in XR Offloaded Tasks Using Pose
              Prediction
            </h2>
            <p className="textOfProject">
              This project was the Masterâ€™s thesis for my degree in Virtual and
              Augmented Reality. The aim was to minimize perceived latency in
              AR/MR applications by using head movement tracking and pose
              prediction algorithms to synchronize content with user movements,
              ensuring a seamless and immersive experience. <br /> <br /> As AR
              and MR glasses advance, offloading computational tasks to edge
              networks or the cloud enhances their capabilities but introduces
              latency issues. Latency, caused by data transmission delays, can
              negatively impact user experience, for example, causing VR
              sickness. By addressing this challenge, our research contributes
              to the development of more practical and user-friendly AR/MR
              devices.

              Real Time Visualization of 5G Signal Waves in AR and VR

            </h2>
            <p className="textOfProject">
              This project involved collaborating with Ericsson to develop a
              system for visualizing real-time 5G directional beams. This
              project aimed to enhance the understanding of 5G technology by
              creating a visual representation of 5G signals within augmented
              and virtual reality environments. <br /> <br /> The visualization
              was deployed in the Ericsson lobby, providing an interactive and
              educational tool to demonstrate the capabilities and behavior of
              5G signal waves. Two versions of the application were developed:
              an AR version for use within the actual Ericsson lobby, and a VR
              version for remote use, allowing users to experience the 5G
              visualizations in a virtual recreation of the lobby.
